## GOALS
The goal of this project is to develop a product that uses satellite image data to:

Showcase other refugee experiences beyond the stories shared today where refugees are not portrayed as every day humans with the same aspirations, lives, and professions as everyday Americans, but in disparaging circumstances;


Increase awareness that can lead to more engaged citizens and increased political pressure on changing legislation and,


Provide another way for prospective donors to be educated around the refugee crisis in turn to take action and donate.

## APPROACH
Building off of the preliminary work from the Seattle DataKindâ€™s DataDive, a dedicated group of five volunteers and four collaborators (Hive and Fast Forward Labs) will build a satellite imagery prototype that monitors refugee camps to raise awareness for refugees.



## PROTOTYPE DESCRIPTION
Satellite technology and machine learning: High resolution satellite image data, when harnessed correctly, can provide highly useful information in the humanitarian response to global crises. Through the process of machine learning, computers can be trained to analyze and recognize satellite images that show us certain patterns and behaviors. This tool, in particular, can teach a computer the dimensions of a tent in a refugee camp and further locate other tents in other refugee camps around the world, cataloging all of the refugee tents in camps worldwide.

Applications: With an increase in the number of displaced people in the world which has led to the construction of new refugee camps, a prototype that uses high resolution satellite imagery data will be built to better visualize the scale of this growth. Potential applications include:

Tents: This tool will monitor the expansion of the refugee population through changes in the camps sizes, labeling and counting tents in refugee camps around the world. This information will be used to bring an understanding to current and prospective donors around how the refugee crisis has grown.


Population Density and Economic: This tool will be built to also identify population density and economic factors including access to transport (rail, road, and air) and clean water resources. This valuable information will be useful in determining where to build refugee camps in the future and also to monitor the economic trends of current refugee camps.

## AUDIENCE
The audience includes fundraising teams - USA for UNHCR staff tasked with executing fundraising campaigns for UNHCR, Communications team - the staff who manage social media accounts, and Hive team - those that use data at USA for UNHCR to better understand and how to optimize our processes. The tool will also be open to the public for educational, and also awareness bringing purposes.   

## KEY MILESTONES
**Milestone 1: Define Project Scope**
All mentioned collaborators will define the project scope including goals, milestones and timeline.

**Milestone 2: Building the Base Deliverable**
Create a prototype that uses satellite imagery to monitor refugee camps.

*Functionality:* The Neural Net Experts will build a baseline product that aggregates satellite image data and combines this data into one product. We recommend the Neural Net team to do further research and also follow the frameworks of some of the tools on the market that use real time satellite image data in monitoring global events/trends.  


*Design (Look and Feel):* The prototype needs to be simple and user friendly for users to easily understand the concentration of refugee camps and tent counts geographically.

**Milestone 3: Make Real-Time**
The Neural Net Experts will use up to date satellite image data at a higher resolution in monitoring refugee camps.

**Milestone 4: Build Minimum Viable Product // Prototype**
The Neural Net Experts will aggregate and visualize up to date satellite image data monitoring refugee camps in a way that will allow partners to effectively explore the data aligned with the goal and applications decided upon in this project.

**Milestone 5: Test Prototype in Live Campaign.**
The Hive Team will market and implement the prototype in an U4U engagement and/or fundraising campaign.
